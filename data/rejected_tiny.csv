1796,10000.0,2007-10-17,"I am a railroad engineer for CSX transportation and am relocating my family to North Carolina.  In order to do this move, we need to settle all of our delinquent debts and move with a clean slate.   My family is my wife, Stacey, our 3 year old daughter, Mackenzie, and our 11 month old son, Noah.   We have a doggie named Dickens, and yes, of course, he's family.  It will cost us a few thousand to relocated with a moving company.  We need payment to rent an apartment and security, etc.    I will be starting a new position in North Carolina, so we will be with little pay until my training session ends.  We need to be able to have money for rent and take care of the children's needs for at least a couple months.    Thank you for your kind consideration.  Mike ",468.0,11.93%,132xx,NY,2 years,0.0

1851,25000.0,2007-10-19,"Greetings!  My wife and I recently purchased a new house in the Palm Springs area and began renting out our first home.  The new home is a condo unit in a country club and was built in the 1950's in a contemporary style.  Even though it is structurally sound, since it is an older place, we undertook a few small projects to update certain areas and improve certain features (such as improving the airflow for our air conditioner).  We ended up overspending our budget, and ended up putting the excess on our credit cards.  We are looking to consolidate some credit card debt that we incurred in the process of fixing up our new place.  I had heard about peer-to-peer lending sites in Consumer Reports' Money magazine, and we are looking to give it a try!",679.0,18.9%,922xx,CO,< 1 year,0.0
